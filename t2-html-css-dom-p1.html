Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would <br>
you describe it to your non-technical friend?
</p>

<p>
  Yes i can, and this analogy comes in two parts. So, part one is html, css <br>
  and the dom is basically another language just like English. Part two is, <br>
  you know the phrase a picture paints a thousand words? well this is painting <br>
  a thousand words in order to write a picture... also the words aren't in <br>
  English, there in html.

What is meant by boxifying design?
</p>

<p>
  Well everything on the web is a box, if you have a circle the bottom line is <br>
  its a picture of a circle in a box. boxing a design is splitting up the <br>
  design into all the boxes that make up the design... i think, that is my take <br>
  on it anyway. :D
</p>

<p>
What is the box model?
</p>

<p>
The "box modle" is a css term refering to the fact that the internet is made up <br>
of boxes within boxes within boxes.
