  <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

  <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
  <p>
    I've always felt i had a strong controll over my emotions when im with other<br>
    people because how other people see me is important to me so i've alway<br>
    thought through my actions. When i am by myself however things are a little<br>
    different, I tend to panic and blame myself when things go wrong and <br>
    although it may take longer, i do end up reminding myself that the problems<br>
    i face are sevearly insignificant compared to the problems i have faced and<br>
    the problems other people face which is the way i controll me emotions, just,<br>
    comparison realy. What this first chapter has taught me was how much further<br>
    I can push my own emotional controll and also how to describe it in words. I<br>
    like how he explains it to other engineers becasue thats exactly how i think<br>
    of things and it helped me to follow along and see the point in all of these<br>
    excersises.

  <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
  <p>
    I tried the two minutes of mindfulness inbetween finishing the first chapter<br>
    and writing this blog and i was surprised at how tiny my attention span<br>
    actualy is. I couldnt just sit and think about my breathing or even just<br>
    thinking about nothing for two minutes, my mind just kept wondering, but. <br>
    Being greatful for just being alive and just well, being, is somthing i <br>
    remind myself of everyday and is not a very forign concept. When i talk to<br>
    people i tend to talk about the good things in my life and it may come across<br>
    to some people as me being cocky and thinking im perfect and im sorry for<br>
    that. Honestly though that is just an insight into my mind because im<br>
    just greatful for everything in my life, and 'just being'. So i think I <br>
    either dont need the meditation or i need to practice at it a whole lot more.<br>
