  <h1>Sprint 1 Time and habits</h1>

  <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>

  <p>i tried a type of meditation, but not any of the types it recommended.
  instead i simply went for a drive out of the city and stoped periodicly every
  time i found a nice spot to appreciate the veiw and just sit and take it all
  in. even simply driving itself i find very relaxing and it takes my mind off
  everything except the road.</p>

  <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>

  <p>i found the creating habbits video very interesting because i dint know
  about it before but ive been slowly doing it  without realising. every day im
  spending a little more time studying, not because i need to but because i
  want to.</p>

  <h2>what worked for you?</h2>

  <p>the meditation worked a treat. i got back from my ride about 20 minutes ago
  and instead of getting to the computer and having no idea where to start my
  mind just seems more clear and its alot easyer to focus.</p>

  <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2>

  <p>i will deffinatly try slotting in shot rides inbetween work and study. i
  think its a good idea to not go straight from work to study and just get that
  half an hour to an hour of meditation inbetween to help my mind transition.</p>
