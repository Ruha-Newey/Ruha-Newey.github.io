  <h1>Sprint 1 reflection blog</h1>

  <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>

  <p>as a whole im excited to get started in the bootcamp as i work better with
  people than i do by myself. to an extent i expected the challenges and am
  looking ford to all of them</p>

  <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>

  <p>at the beggining the most interesting thing was how much web developers
  earn but as i completed assingnments the rewarding feeling of not knowing
  what i am doing and learning my way through the problems became more rewarding
  .</p>

  <h2>what are your impressions?</h2>

  <p>i realy like the learning prossess and how different it is to the
  standard schooling system. here i dont feel like an idiot asking for help as
  manny times as it takes to get it right.</p>

  <h2>how do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>

  <p> </p>

  <h2>have your expectations of EDA changed and if so, how?</h2>

  <p>no, not realy.</p>

  <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does
  it make you nervous?</h2>

  <p> heck yea im excited and worried, im only worried that i will fall further
    behind than i already am but i know what needs to be done to avoid that so
    time to put my head down.</p>
