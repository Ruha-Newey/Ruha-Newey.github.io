<h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
<p>
Grid based design is basically dividing up your website page into a grid to <br>
achieve the structure you want in your website.
</p>

<h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
<p>
Well if your web page isn't responsive then it may be difficult for your<br>
website to be viewed on other devices. For example if your web page is designed<br>
to fit on a regular computer screen and isn't responsive it may look jumbled on<br>
an I phone.
</p>

<h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
<p>
Having a semantic structure means you have semantic tags in your code. An<br>
example of a semantic tag is h1 h2 h3 etc... These are titles.<br>
<h2> This is an h2 title </h2>
</p>

<h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
<p>
Yes, so I think it is amazing that I can just copy stylesheets and CSS codes<br>
online and paste them to my own code. Also to use tools other web developers<br>
have created to literally make there job (and mine) a lot easier. For example<br>
this font IM using came from Google fonts, someone else created it and now I<br>
just get to use it!!
