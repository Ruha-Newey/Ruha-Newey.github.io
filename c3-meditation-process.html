<h1>meditation prosess</h1>

    <h1>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h1>
<p>
  I thought it was a great concept but i didnt think that it could be particularly
  usefull to me because i already consider myself capable of the benfits that can
  be achived through it, ie. happiness, self confidence and emotional control
</p>

    <h1>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h1>
<p>
  I learnt meditation dosent mean sitting in a room by myself being comletly still.
  it can be done on my walk to work or while riding my motorbike.
</p>

    <h1>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h1>
<p>
  honestly no, not really. they all seem standard and commen i just never really
  knew why the were standard and commen. chapter two just took us in depth as to why
  they are the standard thing to do while meditating
</p>

    <h1>Any other musings?</h1>
<p>
  It was interesting to find out that meditating helped your brain with things like
  attention and short term memory, like the blink test thingy with the numbers
